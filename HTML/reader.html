                    “Listen, Mr. Dastych,” Detective Captain Mejzlik said pensively , “the truth of the matter is that I’ve come to you for advice. I have a certain case I don’t know what on earth to do about.”<br>
                    “Out with it then,” said Mr. Dastych. “Whom does the case concern?”<br>
                    “Me,” sighed Dr. Mejzlik. “The more I think about it, the less I understand it. You know, a person could go crazy just thinking about it.”<br>
                    “So who did what to you?” Mr. Dastych asked in a soothing voice.<br>
                    “Nobody,” Dr. Mejzlik burst out. “That’s the worst part of it. I myself did something that I don’t understand.”<br>
                    “Perhaps it’s not all that bad,” old Dastych consoled him. “Just what did you do, young man?”<br>
                    “I caught a safecracker,” Dr. Mejzlik answered gloomily.<br>
                    “And that’s all?” “That’s all.”<br>
                    “And perhaps he wasn’t the right safecracker,” Mr. Dastych said helpfully.<br>
                    “But he was; in fact he’s already confessed. He broke into the safe at the Jewish Benevolent Association; did you hear about it? His name was Rozanowski or Rosenbaum or something, from Lvov,” grumbled Dr. Mejzlik. “They found the safecracking tools on him and everything.”<br>
                    “Well then, what would you like to know?” old Dastych encouraged him.<br>
                    “I would like to know,” the police captain began thoughtfully, “how it was I caught him. Wait, I’ll tell you just what happened. A month ago, it was March third, I was on duty till midnight. I don’t know if you remember, but it had been raining for three days straight.<br>
                    So I stopped in at a coffee shop for a moment, and after that I meant to go right home, to Vinohrady. But instead of that I headed in the opposite direction, toward Dlazdena Street. Tell me, please, do you have any idea why I went straight to that part of town?”<br>
                    “Perhaps it was merely by chance,” Mr. Dastych ventured.<br>
